# Dipblue - A DipGame Bot

DipBlue bot for the Diplomacy Simulator DipGame. 

This project was created during my Masters Thesis with the objective to create a negotiating bot for DipGame with the ability to do Trust Reasoning combined with a simple typical game search based on the board alone. 

## Installation

The installation of this project is similar to [the guide to create a DipGame bot](http://www.dipgame.org/browse/tutorial#CreateBot) provided by Angela Fabregues and the other developers/contributors of the [DipGame](http://www.dipgame.org/).

## Usage

The DipBlue bot can be customized through the `DipBlueBuilder` class. This is done by the GameLauncher class inside my custom [`GameLauncher`](https://github.com/andreferreirav2/dipgame_gamemanager) in which there are multiple versions of the bot, named [`Archetypes`](https://github.com/andreferreirav2/dipgame_gamemanager/blob/master/src/pt/up/fe/mieic/andreferreira/dipblue/game/GameLauncher.java#L181). 
Below are two examples of Archetypes:

```java
/**
 * No communication at all
 */
NO_PRESS(false, false, false, false, false,
        new Class[]{AdviserMapTactician.class},
        new double[]{1.0}),
```

```java
/**
 * With communication, accepts with criteria, requests and keeps trust scores
 */
DIPBLUE(true, true, false, true, true,
        new Class[]{AdviserMapTactician.class, AdviserAgreementExecutor.class, AdviserTeamBuilder.class, AdviserWordKeeper.class},
        new double[]{1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0});
```
